Hello! My name is Rey. I am a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Arizona. My academic journey is deeply rooted in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. 

At the [CLU Lab](https://clulab.org/), under the mentorship of [Dr. Mihai Surdeanu ](https://surdeanu.cs.arizona.edu/mihai/) and [Dr. Steven Bethard](https://bethard.github.io/), I'm exploring the nuances of argument semantics and hallucination detection in text generated by Large Language Models.

Additionally, I was involved in an exciting project at the [Pauli Lab](https://thepaulilab.com/), where I developed Computer Vision models for sorghum panicle detection. This work was in collaboration with a team of scientists at the University of Queensland, Australia, offering a cross-disciplinary approach that blends computer science with agricultural research.

My professional experience includes impactful internships in Machine Learning and Software Engineering, where I've tackled real-world challenges ranging from traffic insights analysis to backend service optimizations.

Beyond academics, I lead the [Google Developer Student Club](https://www.instagram.com/gdsc_ua/) at my university, fostering a community keen on technology and innovation. I also serve as a [College of Science Ambassador](https://science.arizona.edu/person/rey-sanayei) and [Peer Mentor](https://www.cs.arizona.edu/about/cs-buddy-mentor-program), guiding and inspiring my fellow students.

In my free time, I'm an avid soccer player and fan, enjoy action-adventure video games, love traveling to new places, and have a diverse music taste that spans from rap to classical.
